features:
- need constructors for nullable types and interop with other languages

bugs:
- class A { class B { A.B thing } }
  needs to be printed as "A::B thing;" but is currently just "B thing;"
- list literals need work for C++
- need to allow void only for return types
- classes and functions need to be forward declared for C++
- class A { int A }
  needs to be mangled to avoid problems with constructors in C++
